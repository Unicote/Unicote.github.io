My name is Kotya Agapkin, who is called Unicote on the Internet. I am just learning to work on some projects like android roms or scripts in some programming language. I've been using Linux as my main OS for 3 years now and I seem to be good at something already :-)

I prefer Python for programming, but I also learn other languages.

It's hard to see me without writing code or thinking about it, even if you did, I would be sleeping or playing!
