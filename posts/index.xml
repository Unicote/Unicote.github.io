      <description>This post serves as an announcement to the new bugtracker service I have started to use.
This is an unified bugtracker for all projects I work on. People need to report bugs here so that it can be looked after by any of the devs.
Well, the login creds for the issue tracker are as follows.
Username: issue@issue.com
Password: issue
Report the bug at the right project. It will assigned and looked after as soon as possible.</description>

      <description>How to extract vendor blobs from stock rom? I got asked this question a lot, so I&amp;rsquo;ll post it here. Its gonna just be steps on how to do it.
⚠️ Note that you need a fully synced rom source for this.
  Place the Device Tree with the extract-files.sh inside.
  If your device tree doesn&amp;rsquo;t have an extract-files script, get it from github, its almost on every tree.</description>

      <description>Seems like these don’t go hand in hand, does it?
Lemme view it from my perspective.
Recently there was an android kernel developer who tried to monetize his kernel in the most inappropriate way possible. It became disastrous and he became a meme in that process. He was forced to leave development, forever.
So, is monetizing opensource software cancerous?
Red Hat is the global leader in open source software solutions — and has a clear strategy in how to generate revenue.</description>

      <description>Before we start make sure git --version command successfully returns. If the output is something like command not found then please make sure Git is properly installed on your machine. My machine output is shown below. Output on your machine might be different.
 Commands that a user should type on his/her terminal are prefixed with the shell prompt symbol $. The output of command follows the command. Also, you don&amp;rsquo;t have to type $ on your terminal.</description>
